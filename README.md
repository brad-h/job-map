# Job Map

Trying to determine the ideal neighborhood given job listings in the city where I live.

`JobMap.py` uses Selenium to create a CSV file of ZIP code, Company Name, and Position by scraping job listings from (Dice)[http://www.dice.com/].

`JobMapNotebook.py` is a Jupyter notebook that does analysis on the CSV file generated by `JobMap.py` and a (ZIP code CSV database)[http://federalgovernmentzipcodes.us/free-zipcode-database-Primary.csv] (included in this repo as `free-zipcode-database-Primary.csv`.

## Usage

```sh
python3 JobMap.py "City, State" "Job Position"
```
