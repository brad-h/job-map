# Job Map

Trying to determine the ideal neighborhood given job listings in the city where I live.

`job_map.py` uses Selenium to create a CSV file of ZIP code, Company Name, and Position by scraping job listings from [Dice](http://www.dice.com/).

`job_map_notebook.py` is a Jupyter notebook that does analysis on the CSV file generated by `job_map.py` and a [ZIP code CSV database](http://federalgovernmentzipcodes.us/free-zipcode-database-Primary.csv) (included in this repo as `free-zipcode-database-Primary.csv`.

## Usage

To generate `Jobs.csv`, use `job_map.py`
```sh
python3 job_map.py "City, State" "Job Position"
```

To work with the `Jobs.csv` dataset, use the `job_map_notebook.py` Jupyter notebook.
